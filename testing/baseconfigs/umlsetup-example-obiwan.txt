# set BASICROOT this to an unpacked copy of the root file system you

#
# a small-ish one is at:
#     http://junk.sandelman.ca/junk/uml
#
# umlroot-36.. is 6Mb, unpacks to around 26Mb.
#
# I did
#   mkdir -p $UMLPREFIX/basic-root
#   cd $UMLPREFIX/basic-root
#   nftp -o - http://junk.sandelman.ca/freeswan/uml/umlfreeroot-12.0.tar.gz | tar xzvf -

#
# There is an advantage to having this on the same partition as
# $POOLSPACE, as hard links can be used.
