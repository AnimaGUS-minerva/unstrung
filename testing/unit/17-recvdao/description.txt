This test case validates that we can receive a DAO message
from a node of higher rank (further from the root), and that we install
source routes for the destinations listed.

We also reply to the DAO packet with a DAOACK.

The input packet is produced by 24-daoreply, and can be updated with
make pcapupdate.
