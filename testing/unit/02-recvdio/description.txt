This test case validates processing of DIO messages from a captured file.
It should produce a DAO message out again, and configure some routes and the
like on the virtual interfaces.
The input file, ../INPUTS/senddio.pcap was created by test case 12.

Much of this test is probably now captured in test case 24, and so this test
case has been removed from the regular list.
