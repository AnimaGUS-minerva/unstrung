This test case receives two DIO messages: one for a DAGID that
     is interesting, and another for a DAGID that is not interesting.

The interesting DAGID will result in a DIO being scheduled, as well
    as a DAO being scheduled.

The ../INPUTS/dio-19-t1.pcap file is produced by 12-senddio step 3,
which is also used in 24-daoreply, and therefore is not updated here.
