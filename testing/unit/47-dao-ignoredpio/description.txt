This test case is similar to 24-daoreply, in that a DIO is received
from the parent, and then a DAO, and then a DAOACK.

This node has it's address set via a certificate, and so it does not
configure an address based upon the DIO's PIO.  It does however:

1) include the configured address in it's DAO.
2) configure a route via parent for the prefix in the PIO.
