This test case validates a node intermediate (E) in the mesh will
reply accurately to a DAO from a lower node (J), putting appropriate
route entries, and then sending up a DAO to the parent.

This is similar to test case 24, but it goes a step further,
listening for the DAO from node J below this node E.

QUESTION: do we wait for the DAOACK from the parent before sending
our DAOACKs?

The daoJ from node J comes from test case: 39-daoJ.
