This test case validates that we can receive a DIO message
from a node of higher rank, and that we will ignore it, because we
are already lower rank than it.
This test case starts out with the assumption that the DAG
was originally announced from this node, so the DIO we would have sent
is actually built (but not sent), and then we start to listen for
the reply.

The dio-E.pcap file was produced by the UNTI test harness and captured.
